# AI-Assisted Development Workflows

This folder contains guides for AI-assisted development practices used in this project.

## Purpose

These guides document how to effectively work with AI coding assistants like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and ChatGPT when contributing to this project.

## Available Guides

- [Context Management](CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md) - Managing AI context across sessions and models (comprehensive guide with 80%+ token savings)

## When to Use These Guides

**You should read these if you:**
- Want to understand how this project was built
- Are using AI tools to contribute to this project
- Need to transfer context between AI sessions (e.g., Claude → ChatGPT)
- Want to learn efficient AI workflow patterns
- Are interested in AI-assisted software development methodology

**You can skip these if you:**
- Just want to play the game
- Are contributing without AI assistance
- Only need game feature documentation

## Relationship to Project

This project embraces AI-assisted development as a modern software practice. These guides:
1. Document the methodology used to build the game
2. Help contributors work effectively with AI tools
3. Share knowledge with the broader development community
4. Demonstrate best practices for AI-human collaboration

## Context Management Overview

The [Context Management guide](CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md) covers:
- Delta-structured context methods (83.6% token reduction)
- Context collapse detection and prevention
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- Templates and best practices
- Cross-model context transfer strategies

This is particularly useful for:
- Long development sessions
- Switching between AI models
- Maintaining context across days/weeks
- Team collaboration with AI tools

## Contributing

If you have AI workflow tips or improvements:
1. Update the relevant guide in this folder
2. Follow the existing markdown format
3. Include practical examples
4. Test your suggestions
5. Submit a pull request

## Project-Specific AI Usage

For project-specific AI instructions and architecture:
- See [AI-Assisted Development Guide](../development/AI_ASSISTED_DEV.md) - How this specific project uses AI
- See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - AI assistant guide with project architecture (in root directory)

The difference:
- **This folder**: General AI workflow techniques
- **AI_ASSISTED_DEV.md**: SimCity-specific AI usage patterns
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project architecture for AI assistants
